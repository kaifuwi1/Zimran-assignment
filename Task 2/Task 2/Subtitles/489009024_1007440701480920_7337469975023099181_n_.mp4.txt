Why should we hire you instead of using AI? That's the new question. Watch this or get left behind. Disappear for one month to become the most dangerous person in the room. First, stop scrolling. Second, take a one minute quiz. Third, spend 15 minutes a day learning new skills. And the last, become a master of AI tools. In one week, you'll feel unstoppable. In two weeks, you'll have your strategy. In four weeks, you'll wonder why you didn't start sooner. You in? Try now.
